# SchoolDistanceFindeR
Find Schools Nearby
* R code to find schools within a certain distance of a target school. Good for comparison of school to nearby schools and this is generally just to make my life easier.
* got the data from https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp
* download it and run it in R!
* distance is pretty rounded bc the earth is a sphere and I use 69 as a degree multiplier
